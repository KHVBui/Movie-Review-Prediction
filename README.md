# Movie-Review-Prediction
A machine learning model that will predict whether a movie review is positive or negative using binary text classification and the scikit-learn library

1. Used a dataset from IMDB 
2. Prepared the data and dealt with imbalanced classes using random under sampling
3. Splitted data into training and test sets
5. Determined the accuracy of different Classification algorithms
6. Determined the best model to be the Support Vector Machines (SVM) model (Out of SVM, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression) using the mean accuracy
7. Evaluated model using the F1 score, a classification report, and the confusion matrix
8. Tuned the model using GridSearchCV
